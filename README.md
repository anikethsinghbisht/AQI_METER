# AQI_METER
To analyze historical air quality data across major Indian cities and build a forecasting  model to predict future pollution levels. The project aims to uncover patterns and trends  in air pollution (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, etc.) and provide actionable insights for  policymakers 

Key Work Done: 
● Cleaned and preprocessed raw AQI data to handle missing and inconsistent 
values 
● Conducted EDA to study pollutant distributions and seasonal trends 
● Visualized data using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and interactive dashboards 
● Applied Time Series Forecasting using ARIMA and Facebook Prophet models 
● Compared models to choose the best-performing forecasting approach 
● Identified high-risk zones and peak pollution periods 
● Suggested policy-level interventions and public health recommendations based 
on insights.
